        <h1>About EduTracker</h1>
        <p>
            EduTracker is an educational tracking application designed to help users manage their learning
            journey effectively. Whether you're a student, professional, or lifelong learner, EduTracker offers
            a streamlined platform to track your educational goals, monitor your progress, and stay organized
            throughout your learning process.
            <br/><br/>
            With EduTracker, you can create and manage a personalized list of skills, subjects, or topics that
            you want to learn or improve upon. The application provides an intuitive interface where you can add
            new items to your learning list, including a title, description, and optional YouTube tutorial URL.
            <br/><br/>
            Once you've added an item to your list, you can track your progress by updating its status.
            EduTracker offers three status levels: <strong>TO LEARN</strong>, <strong>LEARNING</strong>, and
            <strong>LEARNED</strong>. This gives you a clear overview of your learning journey.
